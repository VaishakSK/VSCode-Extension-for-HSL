# HSL IDE Components ‚Äì VSCode Extension

## üìå Overview

The **HSL IDE Components** project is a custom **Visual Studio Code extension** created using the **Yo Code generator** to provide complete development support for **HSL (Hardware Sequence Language)**.
It integrates intelligent editing, compiler support, debugging, and real-time diagnostics to enhance productivity for hardware engineers working with HSL.

## üõ† About Yo Code Generation Tool

The **Yo Code generator** is a scaffolding tool provided by Microsoft to quickly create the structure for a VS Code extension. It is built on **Yeoman**, a popular code generator framework, and simplifies the process of setting up a new extension project with all required configuration files and boilerplate code.

**How it is used in this project:**

1. **Project Initialization** ‚Äì The `yo code` command was used to create the base project folder structure, including `package.json`, activation scripts, command registration, and contribution points.
2. **Language Configuration** ‚Äì Configurations for `.hsl` files were added to enable syntax highlighting, hover information, and diagnostics.
3. **API Integration** ‚Äì The generated code was extended using VS Code APIs to implement features like IntelliSense, compiler hooks, and debugging tools.
4. **Testing Environment** ‚Äì The Yo Code scaffold includes a ready-to-use debug configuration, making it easy to run and test the extension in an **Extension Development Host** window.

**Key Uses of Yo Code in Development:**

* Rapidly scaffolding a working extension framework.
* Automatically generating command and activation event handlers.
* Managing the `contributes` section in `package.json` for editor integration.
* Providing a ready-to-run development environment for faster testing.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Hardware engineers working with **HSL** lacked an integrated development environment that could provide syntax awareness, intelligent recommendations, debugging capabilities, and compiler integration within a single editor.
This project addresses that gap by delivering an **all-in-one VS Code extension** tailored for HSL development.

## üöÄ Features

* **Syntax Highlighting** ‚Äì Clear, color-coded representation of HSL keywords, variables, and operators.
* **Syntax Recommendations** ‚Äì Intelligent suggestions to reduce syntax errors and improve coding speed.
* **Auto-completion** ‚Äì Context-aware completion for functions, keywords, and variables.
* **Error Detection & Diagnostics** ‚Äì Real-time feedback and detection of multiple errors in a single compilation cycle.
* **Compiler Integration** ‚Äì Cross-platform support for executing and compiling HSL code.
* **Debugging Tools** ‚Äì Integrated OPAL-based debugging for dynamic policy management and decision-making.
* **Hover Provider** ‚Äì Displays detailed contextual information on hover.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

* **Visual Studio Code API** ‚Äì Core API for building and extending VS Code functionality.
* **Yo Code Generator (Yeoman)** ‚Äì Tool used to scaffold the extension‚Äôs base structure.
* **TypeScript** ‚Äì Language used to implement extension logic with strong typing.
* **OPAL** ‚Äì Enables real-time debugging and decision-making integration.
* **Cross-Platform Compiler** ‚Äì Supports compilation on different operating systems.

## üìê Methodology

1. **Extension Scaffolding** ‚Äì Used the Yo Code generator to create the project‚Äôs initial file and folder structure.
2. **Language Configuration** ‚Äì Defined `.hsl` file syntax rules and tokenization for highlighting.
3. **Feature Development** ‚Äì Implemented IntelliSense, hover provider, and error diagnostics using VS Code APIs.
4. **Compiler Integration** ‚Äì Linked cross-platform compiler to enable compilation from within VS Code.
5. **Debugging Integration** ‚Äì Integrated OPAL for real-time debugging support.
6. **Testing & Validation** ‚Äì Verified the extension across operating systems to ensure compatibility and performance.
